The coefficients c, and the covariance matrix is given as: 
c =       4.95      -0.17 
Covariance matrix S = 
   0.00115  -0.000178 
 -0.000178   4.83e-05 
lambda = 0.16989 pm 0.0070
T_0.5 = 4.08 pm 0.17 days
Theoretical halflife 3.8235 days from wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon-222
The calculated T_0.5 is agrees with the theoretical halflife

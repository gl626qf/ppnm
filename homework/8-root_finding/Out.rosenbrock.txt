----Extremum for Rosenbrock's vally function----
Compare the numerical and analytical roots of Rosenbrock's valley function.
Rosenbrock's vally function : f(x,y)=(1-x)^2+100(y-x^2)^2
Gradient analytical: (-2*(1-x)-400*x*(y-x^2),200*(y-x^2))
Initial vector : 2.5, 4
x_roots =          1          1 
f(roots) =  -8.48e-14   4.44e-14 
The correct result for roots is x = 1, y = 1
The solutions are the same.
